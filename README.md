# HockeyRATS

![HockeyRATS Logo](/src/images/hockeyrats-logo-cropped.svg)

The home of fanatics who live to train and play hockey. Pioneer of the R.A.T.S.
training system.

This repository contains the third iteration of the
[HockeyRATS website](http://www.hockeyrats.com) hosted on GitHub Pages. It is
developed with TypeScript, a strongly typed language built on JavaScript and
Gatsby, a React-based open source static site framework. Bootstrap v5 is
integrated for responsive and mobile-friendly styling without jQuery.
Prettier and ESLint provide code formatting and static analysis respectively.
Summaries of previous site versions can be found in the
[Prior Iterations](#prior-iterations) section.
